                We believe in the inspired and infallible authority of the
                Bible. There is one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy
                Spirit. Jesus Christ is divine, born of a virgin, lived
                sinlessly, performed miracles, died for our sins, rose again,
                and will return in glory

                We exist to serve God through proclaiming the Good News of Jesus
                Christ to the peoples so that people may have eternal life and
                become Christâ€™s disciples, and be fulfilled spiritually,
                mentally, and physically so that they become salt and light to

                    Joining LKHC Youth has been an incredible journey of
                    personal growth for me. Through the various programs,
                    events, and mentorship opportunities, I have been able to
                    develop my faith, character, and leadership skills. The
                    youth leaders at LKHC are passionate about investing in the
                    lives of young people, and their guidance and support have
                    played a significant role in shaping my spiritual journey. I
                    am grateful for the transformative experiences I have had
                    and the lifelong friendships I have formed through LKHC
                    Youth."

                    acceptance I have felt within this community is truly
                    remarkable. The youth group at LKHC is filled with genuine
                    love and support, and it has been a place LKHC Youth has
                    become my spiritual family, and I am forever grateful for
                    the ways it has shaped my relationship with God."

                    Experiencing intimate worship has been a truly
                    transformative encounter for me. The atmosphere of worship
                    within this community is filled with passion, authenticity,
                    and a hunger for God's presence. The worship team at LKHC
                    leads us into heartfelt worship, creating a space where we
                    can connect with God on a deeper level. Through powerful
                    songs, prayer, and moments of reflection, I have encountered
                    the love and power of God in a tangible way.
